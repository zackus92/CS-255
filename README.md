Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well? : 

The DriverPass project was to design a system for a client named DriverPass. The client wanted a user-friendly online platform that let users schedule driving lessons, manage accounts, and stay up to date with with DMV regulations. I was trying to make an easy to follow set of documents, including the business requirements, use case diagrams, and activity diagrams, that showed the system's functions and how a user will interact with it.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? : 

If I could go back to one part, I would focus on making the UML class diagram more intricate so there is a more detailed representation of the system's classes and attributes.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? : 

Interpreting user needs is vital in system design because it ensures that the finisherd product aligns with the user's expectations and functionalities, leading to more intuative UI, which would make any user happy.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system : 

Keeping this organized is key! I would gather what the client wants out of their system. Then, given the requirements, I can create visuals using UML diagrams and design the system. Having consitant feedback from the client as well as team members can help to produce a system that is exactly what the client wants. In the days ahead, I will definitely keep things user friendly, stick with agile methods and of course stay up to date on the new tech and methods that are being used.
